# SEM-3 Time_Table_Generator_Using_Java
<br>
<h1>This Project is a group project of four people 👨🏽‍🤝‍👨🏼👩🏽‍🤝‍🧑🏼</h1>

This java program generates time table based on certain rules.

<h1> Rules 🎯 </h1>

A Teacher has a maximum of 2 lectures in a day. <br>
A Teacher can take a maximum of 1 lecture in a particular class in a day.<br>
A Teacher can take a maximum of 2 lectures in a particular class in a week.<br>
A Class has a maximum of 3 lectures in a day.

<h1> Note ⚠️ </h1>

Teachers, their Courses, and Classes are hardcoded. They all are stored in their specific Arrays. But you can change the data to use that program for your needs.<br>

<b>Flow</b>
When the program starts to execute, it asks how many Rooms are available and their capacity. And asks the capacity of the Classes.

<h1>What it does 🔎</h1>

It checks that whether at a particular time slot:-

A particular Teacher is free <br>
A particular Class is free <br> 
Any room is available <br>
If a room is available, would it have the capacity to fit the class in? <br> 
Considering all these checks and the above rule program generates a timetable 🚩. At the end, the program also displays the Classes that are unable to take all their lectures.

<h1>Instructions 🔊</h1> <br>

Follow the below step to run the code: <br>

cd timetable-generator <br>
javac Main.java <br>
java Main.java <br>
